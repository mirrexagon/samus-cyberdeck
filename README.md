# Samus Cyberdeck

I want to gut one of my Chromebook Pixel 2015s (codename Samus) and make something like this with it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR3kf-nUY-s

## Requirements and compromises
- Keep the lightbar, including tap for battery level functionality
- Expose at least these external ports: two USB-C, two USB-A
    - Nice to have: SD card reader, headset jack
- Speakers not required
